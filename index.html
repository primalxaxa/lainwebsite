        <h2>This is my journal as I build the online schitzo-lair that is this website.</h2>
        <p>This main page is dedicated to providing updates on the website for anyone who visits to see. It's a great way for me to document my progress as well.</p>
        <p>This website is a passion project of mine and just contains stuff that I think is cool or I am interested in.</p>
        <p>I am a university student in Washington State.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (8/19/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I have restructured the website. I have added the links to their own page to avoid clutter as I add more pages to the website. I have also added a pictures and music page to the website. The pictures page will have random pictures I feel like adding to it. For right now, the music page just has my spotify playlist. I will probably add more music to the music page in the future.</p>
        
        <br><br>

        <h2><center><i><u>Update (9/13/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I have added a cool background to the pictures and music page since there is no text to read. I have also added a new song to the music page that is not part of my spotify playlist (youtube video embed). I have also continued to add pictures to the pictures page randomly throughout the last few weeks.</p>
        <br><br>

        <h2><center><i><u>Update (9/14/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>Decided to add backgrounds to all the pages and change the main text to white for legibility reasons. I have added background music to all the pages except for the music page (obviously). If you can't hear it it's likely because your browser is blocking it and you can allow the music to play to the left of where the URL is. If you don't want to hear the music you can mute the tab. I have also added a suprise on the links page.</p>
        <br><br>
        
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (10/25/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>The site was recently offline for a day as I migrated the domain over to SquareSpace. Google domains was bought out by them. The site is still running off of github but the domain is registered with SquareSpace instead of Google.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <h2><center><i><u>Update (11/3/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I just added a feature I will likely expand on in the future. I have added raw lossless music files from my collection on this site that you can access from the music page. Github only allows me to upload files up to 25 mb so some of the songs I want to add might have to be converted to mp3 format. I will label all the files with their formats. I will be fleshing this out more with more music in the future.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>

        <h2><center><i><u>Update (12/4/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>Added a Santa hat to Lain below. Happy Holidays!</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (12/16/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I started a minecraft server. It is running on my thinkpad t440s. The version of minecraft it is running on is 1.19.2 If you want to join it the link is <a href="minecraft.html">here</a>. You also need to download <a href="music/server_mods.zip">forge 1.19.2</a> and add my <a href="music/server_mods.zip">mods</a> which you can download from the hyperlinks I just provided. I will also be putting all of this under the minecraft server link on the links page.
