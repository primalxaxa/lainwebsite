        <h2>This is my journal as I build the online schitzo-lair that is this website.</h2>
        <p>This main page is dedicated to providing updates on the website for anyone who visits to see. It is a great way for me to document my progress as well.</p>
        <p>This website is a passion project of mine and just contains stuff that I think is cool or I am interested in.</p>
        <p>I am a university student in Washington State.</p>

	<h2><center><i><u>Update (7/21/24)</u></i></center></h2>
	<p>I have started up my new minecraft server. It is running on my main computer this time so tech specs should not be an issue. The minecraft server is now a 1.21 vanilla server. There is no barrier to entry now. You just have to put the server address in which can be found on the links page. For more information about the server or to chat with people, join my discord server (also in the links page). <p>
<br><br><br><br>

	<br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (7/15/24)</u></i></center></h2>
	<p>I have launched my new website. It is an image board akin to 4chan and functions in the same way. You can post pictures and type messages which everyone can see. like 4chan, it is anonymous by default. The link is <a href="https://librechan.org">here</a> if you would like to use it. It will also be added to the links page.<p>
<br><br><br><br>



	
	<br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (6/13/24)</u></i></center></h2>
	<p>I have added more pictures. I have also added a donation address for my monero and bitcoin wallets to the footer of all of the pages. I also did some light updates to the my setup page since I have recently switched the OS on my main computer to Endeavour(Arch Linux).<p>
<br><br><br><br>


	<br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (5/16/24)</u></i></center></h2>
	<p>I am starting an email list so I can more easily notify people when I update my website with new features or, more likely, post pictures of my cat. If you would like to join you can click <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/1+kfIKTkWNOZDiSp4HzobLPILc7NDwtYmfU6NpR6IHU/">here</a> or go to the links tab of my website.<p>
<br><br><br><br>


	<br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (5/7/24)</u></i></center></h2>
	<p>I have added a new page called "My Setup". It has information about what computer hardware and software I use.<p>
<br><br><br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (4/29/24)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I wanted to let everyone know that the Minecraft server has been inactive for a few months. The hardware I was running it on was too weak to support more than 2 or 3 people (10 year old dual core ultrabook processor). I will relaunch it once I acquire better dedicated server hardware.</p>
<br><br><br><br>

	<h2><center><i><u>Update (4/3/24)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I have added a few new pictures to the pictures (one of my cat). I also switched the order of the posts to be newest first instead of newest last.</p>
      
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (1/2/24)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>Happy New Year! I have added a few new pictures (both green texts) that I thought were funny.</p>

	<br><br><br><br>

	<h2><center><i><u>Update (12/16/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I started a modded minecraft server. It is running on one my thinkpads (t440s) in my closet. The version of minecraft it is running on is 1.19.2 If you want to join it the link is <a href="minecraft.html">here</a>. You also need to download <a href="music/forge-1.19.2-43.3.0-installer.jar">forge 1.19.2</a> and add my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YdVTJt-12UnipmF_Roc9fBV9dHfd3xXX?usp=sharing">mods</a> which you can download from the hyperlinks I just provided. I will also be putting all of this under the minecraft server link on the links page.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

        <h2><center><i><u>Update (12/4/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>Added a Santa hat to Lain below. Happy Holidays!</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        
        
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (11/3/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I just added a feature I will likely expand on in the future. I have added raw lossless music files from my collection on this site that you can access from the music page. Github only allows me to upload files up to 25 mb so some of the songs I want to add might have to be converted to mp3 format. I will label all the files with their formats. I will be fleshing this out more with more music in the future.</p>

	<br><br><br><br>
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (10/25/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>The site was recently offline for a day as I migrated the domain over to SquareSpace. Google domains was bought out by them. The site is still running off of github but the domain is registered with SquareSpace instead of Google.</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (9/14/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>Decided to add backgrounds to all the pages and change the main text to white for legibility reasons. I have added background music to all the pages except for the music page (obviously). If you can't hear it it's likely because your browser is blocking it and you can allow the music to play to the left of where the URL is. If you don't want to hear the music you can mute the tab. I have also added a suprise on the links page.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
        <h2><center><i><u>Update (9/13/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I have added a cool background to the pictures and music page since there is no text to read. I have also added a new song to the music page that is not part of my spotify playlist (youtube video embed). I have also continued to add pictures to the pictures page randomly throughout the last few weeks.</p>	
<br><br><br><br>
	<h2><center><i><u>Update (8/19/23)</u></i></center></h2>
        <p>I have restructured the website. I have added the links to their own page to avoid clutter as I add more pages to the website. I have also added a pictures and music page to the website. The pictures page will have random pictures I feel like adding to it. For right now, the music page just has my spotify playlist. I will probably add more music to the music page in the future.</p>
